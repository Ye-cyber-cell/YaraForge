## 📝 What is YaraForge?

YaraForge is a tool designed to help you create, manage, and test YARA rules. YARA rules are used to find and identify files or processes that match certain patterns. This can help detect malware or suspicious activity on your computer or network. 

YaraForge makes it easy by giving you a user-friendly way to build these rules. You don’t need to be a programmer or know complex code. You can also see how your detection rules relate to known cyber threats using a mapping system called MITRE ATT&CK. Finally, you get a simple dashboard to watch your detection results in real time.

The program is built using Python and Flask. You don’t need to know these technologies to use YaraForge, but they help keep it fast and reliable.
